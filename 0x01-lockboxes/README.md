# Project Name
**0x01. Lockboxes**

## Must Know

For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

### Concepts Needed:

1.  **Lists and List Manipulation**:
    
    -   Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
    -   [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TtGNy9p1p1d0O5G1rdY1Aw "Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)")
2.  **Graph Theory Basics**:
    
    -   Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
    -   [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html "Graph Theory (Khan Academy)")
3.  **Algorithmic Complexity**:
    
    -   Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
    -   [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs "Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)")
4.  **Recursion**:
    
    -   Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
    -   [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/ "Recursion in Python (Real Python)")
5.  **Queue and Stack**:
    
    -   Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
    -   [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/ "Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)")
6.  **Set Operations**:
    
    -   Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
    -   [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets "Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)")

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).


## Project Description

* **0. Lockboxes** - Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened. - `0-rectangle.py`.
